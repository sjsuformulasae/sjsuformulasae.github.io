									In order to compete in Formula SAE, the Spartan Racing team designs, builds, and tests a new Formula style racecar each year based on regulations and standards similar to those imposed
									on professional motor sport teams. This exercise immerses students of all backgrounds in an environment that parallels that of a competitive work environment and professional race team. The multidimensional nature of the Formula SAE experience is an invaluable educational experience.

          As a first year member of SJSU FSAE, I felt as if walking into another world, witnessing the the hard work and determination that surrounded me. Everyday I visited the shop, I was inspired by those who never failed to portray their undying efforts to develop a product they were all passionate about. Observing such a dynamic and dedicated team, I was inspired to do the same and strive the achieve the most I could do with my efforts. As a member of the Business subteam, I have had numerous roles, one of them being to brainstorm ideas and events for purposes, ranging from team bonding to fundraising. I have also had the role of developing our business presentation, a process in which I was able to gain a large amount of knowledge regarding finances, business solutions, and the functions of a business team.

          As a member of the business team I get hands on experience with real world case studies, managing finances, as well as networking with some of the most talented individuals I have ever met. This semester, I was in charge of the data analysis for our business presentation, and attained hands on experience with corporate finances.

          I joined this team as a freshman knowing exactly what I would be getting out of joining such a prestigious team before even meeting the rest of the membership or attended the first event.  Some students join because they want to mark off a box on their resume, and I do not blame them because this collegiate design series team is an extremely valuable thing to have listed on your resume. But more importantly, i joined to become exposed to the real-world, fast-paced, competitive, and business-like environment that is Formula SAE. This is more than just a team that builds a race-car every year and competes at competition, it is a student run organization where I have developed managerial skills, manufacturing expertise, financial planning, life-long friendships, and a go do it mentality. For me, this was the perfect opportunity to progressively use what I learned in my classes as a manufacturing major and business minor through the club to solve real-world issues that are very similar to those in companies with manufacturing and engineering teams so that when I graduate, I will be ready to walk into my job and start from wherever they need me.

          My name is AJ Villaroman and this is my first year as a member of Spartan Racing. As a student with a background in business (specifically MIS), I wanted to gain a hands on experience working with others in an environment outside of the classroom. Given my life-long interest in cars and motorsport, I knew that joining the Spartan Racing business team was a perfect fit for me. Throughout this past school year I have learned a lot about what it takes to run a business team for a racing organization. My tasks have included graphic design, fundraiser organization, and even building on the beautiful website that has been left behind for us by our alumni. I would definitely say that joining Spartan Racing has been an educational experience, and can't wait to get started on our future projects and endeavors.

          My name is Samrat Yadav and I am a third-year Management Information Systems student at SJSU. For my first two years, I was a full-time software engineering student and decided to switch over to MIS while completing a minor in Comp Sci side by side in the beginning of my third year. I have been working with the SJSU FSAE business team for this past semester   as we have found a solution and developed a presentation to our prompt of "cutting down 90% R&D costs due to an economic turndown." We have used data analytics strategies on Excel along with cost-cutting techniques with the help of our Chief Engineer to come with this solution. Due to the COVID-19, we are working on this presentation via zoom, but I plan on working with FSAE next semester too with hopes of the SJSU campus opening up again!

          As an Intern, I was able to gain valuable experience from each sub-team. I learned how to lay carbon fiber with aerodynamics, how the 4-stroke engine works, the importance of cooling and how the system works, as well as how to take apart SR-11 which exponentially increased my understanding of a race car.

          For the 2019 and 2020 season, I was a designer for the intake system of the car. This was my first season experiencing what it was like to be a designer. The design experience has not only helped me learn a lot about the specific system I am designing, but also it has given me valuable insight into the process of designing a single sub-system and having it work properly in a large assembly of other systems. Designing a sub-system has given me insight  as to what it will be like designing and tackling projects in the professional engineering world. Just 1 season of being a designer has already taught me numerous things I never would have learned in just a classroom.          </p>

          As a part of powertrain, my main job was to help keep the "heart" of the car running. When I first joined the team back in the summer of 2019 I didn't have any other new members to stick with so I bonded more with the previous members and helped them with their jobs. Most of the time it was just taking apart SR-11 for testing and maintenance purposes. As I became more acquainted and comfortable with the team, I was able to work on more complex tasks such as creating accurate CAD models for various parts of the engine and help taking apart spare engines to put onto the dyno for testing.

          I am the intake system designer for SR12. Because a combustion engine is just a complex air pump, the intake systems purpose is to adequately distribute air into each cylinder of the engine. After a lot of research during the initial design phase of the intake system, I found that changing the entry position of the air within the plenum would help equally distributing air to the engine. The challenge was manufacturing the system out of carbon fiber and integrating the system such that it didn't discount the vehicle dynamics of SR12. Unfamiliar with carbon fiber manufacturing, I decided to change a few components of the current system to gain a better

          I joined FSAE in Fall of 2019 as part of my senior design project. I designed the gearing ratios in parallel with the shifting designers as well as tried to improve the overall design of our final drive rear sprocket. Challenges came from calculating optimal gear ratios based on desired peak torque and speed of vehicle, calculating the load the final drive system experiences, and creating a CAD model of the rear sprocket which we could perform simulations on. We ended up creating two different rear sprockets of two different sizes which will be tested in the engine dynamometer using different configurations of the gear box. After the CAD work was done, topology optimization and FEA was performed on the rear sprocket and substantial improvements were made compared to last year. The mass of the rear sprocket was reduced by up to 49% and the moment of inertia about its axis of rotation was reduced by up to 52% compared to last year’s sprocket. Although the project is very fast paced, I couldn’t have asked for a better way to finish my last year of undergraduate studies. Being a designer for this project has allowed me to apply class knowledge, learn new things, and be part of something that is significantly bigger than myself.

          The purpose of the exhaust system is to remove the waste gas out of the engine through a series of pipes. For performance in a naturally aspirated engine, exhaust must be tuned with the intake system to scavenge gases at a certain point in the RPM range in order to pull in more fresh air, increasing the power output. An issue we encountered was welding the exhaust. Exhaust material used was titanium. Titanium is very sensitive and reactive material, so it has to be properly prepped prior to welding and the welder has to have enough practice with the material in order to get proper welds. Another issue was midpipe placement. The chassis had a design change that we had to account for, so midpipe design had to change. With this chassis change, muffler mounting points also change.

					I am a transfer student who drove across the country to become an engineer in Silicon Valley. Joining the FSAE was one of the best career choices I have made. The welcoming environment and the fierce competition has put me on the path to becoming the type of engineer I want to be. It has forced me to apply all of the theoretical and technical knowledge I have learned throughout my educational career, and then some. From composites to structural analysis and from electrical circuitry to system kinematics, FSAE is where to learn and apply them all. If you are looking to advance your career, network and pick up a few life-long friends on the way, this is the place for you!

          I've been involved with Spartan Racing for two semesters now. I came on as an intern during Fall '19 and have since then been familiarizing myself with SR-12 and the suspension sub-team through intern projects and helping with test days. I've been able to witness the development of SR-12 and one intern project had me and another intern think up a way to measure and validate bump steer data on last years car. During the current semester, I have been helping machine components for SR-12 and learning to operate a manual lathe and milling machine. I hope that in spite of the recent events, SR-12 can be on the ground soon. I'll be making a huge leap next semester by stepping up to be suspension team lead.

          Upon initially joining the Spartan Racing FSAE team, I assumed it would only be a fun way of working with people that share similar interests to me. However, throughout the past two years, I have realized that this team is a full-fledged introduction to the engineering industry. Through my time on the suspension subteam, my understanding of the design process has grown exponentially from the teachings of other members, and has far surpassed anything I’ve learned from the classroom thus far. For the past season, my task was to research and design parts for the outboard suspension, a process consisting of research, data analysis from previous cars, computer aided design (CAD), and testing for validation. The people I’ve met from this team have been extraordinarily helpful in teaching me techniques for being successful in this process, to where I can confidently design parts that I am proud of.

          When I first joined the team, all of my work was centered around designing a simulation of the engine within Ricardo WAVE. Once manufacturing season started, my powertrain lead farmed me out to the suspension and chassis teams for fabrication jobs. I had work almost every morning, but I'd wake up at the crack of dawn just to get into the shop as soon as it opened. This past semester I probably put in upwards of 30 hours a week to make sure we were on schedule for our first drive.

          The Chassis sub-team focuses on frame design of the car, ergonomics, and safety systems. In order to engineer a fast car, gains in structural stiffness can improve the performance of the car drastically. Ergonomic systems that have been touched by chassis development to improve driver performance include pedal box placement, steering wheel position and design, seat angle and position, and dashboard arrangement.

          Designed and manufactured headrest, firewall, seat, and pedal tray for the Spartan Racing 2020 car, SR-12. Pedal tray was required to be withstand 2000N of force on the brake pedal, be properly constrained in all directions, be adjustable to accommodate a 95th percentile male and a 5th percentile female, while retaining ease of serviceability. Rotary sensor integration was the most aspect, and underwent several changes before settling on the final design.

          I am a Senior with 8+ years of professional automotive experience. In the 18-19 school year, I was a member of the Powertrain sub-team where I undertook activities such as engine R&R and machining of replacement parts for the car. For the 19-20 school year, I was part of the Chassis sub-team, but assisted in multiple other areas of the team, ranging from creation of sensor test fixtures to obtaining part sponsorships.

          My name is Chris Van and I was a system designer in charge of the inboard suspension which includes the A-Arms, push/pull rod linkages, shocks, springs, and ARBs. The design and function of the inboard suspension is directly related to the handling characteristics of the car. When designing suspension, one of the greatest challenges is packaging and system integration, which includes problems such as making sure your parts work well with other systems while still performing its primary function. Prior to FSAE my knowledge of racing and building cars was mostly in practice and less in theory. Being on the team has allowed me to bridge the gap between theory and application. FSAE not only develops practical skills such as design, manufacturing, assembly of components, but also real-world engineering skills such as project management, conducting design review presentations, and communication skills. At times, the work can be very challenging, but ultimately the camaraderie is what makes you stay.

          In the last season I worked on the electro-pneumatic shifting system for the car, primarily working to improve the reliability of shifting system. I redesigned existing systems to address heat and abrasion induced failures that had occurred, as well as incorporating the diagnosis of parts that experienced premature failures. One of the most effective changed was upgrading the pneumatic tubing to PTFE tubing, increasing the temperature tolerance of the system greatly. By incorporating those constraints, I was able to quickly preform incremental upgrades to the test vehicle and validate any possible improvements in reliability. By preforming incremental changes and validation I was able to quickly improve reliability by addressing the lowest hanging fruit. I also worked on fixing the kinematics of the existing shifting actuator to add additional shifting reliability and prevent miss shifts, all while decreasing design complexity and improving the serviceability of the powertrain system as a whole.

          My name is Nathaniel Irpan and I'm currently a sophomore that has been with the team for two years. I'm part of the Aerodynamics sub team as a designer for the rear wing of the car which is essential towards generating the car's down force. One of the challenges that I always face is how can I always make sure that what I design is whats best for the car as not only do I have to ensure that the design performs well enough on its own I also have to make sure that it integrates well with the whole car. To solve these issues, I turned to my fellow team members and asked what needed and how that would affect me so that I could narrow down what I was required and taught myself the skills and knowledge so that the rear wing could satisfy them.

          For the 2019 season I worked on SR12's Rear Wing. Because we had to cut the weight down by 5 lbs from SR11's rear wing (as part of the design requirement), we decided to switch from wet-layup to prepreg process to reduce the resin content, and also to switch from a foamcore which soaks up a lot of resin to a Nomex honeycomb core. Going to a prepreg process means the mold has to withstand temperature and be able to go inside an oven, which the SR11 mold couldn't because it was made of wood. A metal frame mold was made and welded, and it was successfully used.  Aside from doing research in CFD in the Aerospace Engineering department, I'm using the Formula SAE opportunity to gain practical experience. Having to make everything from scratch, learning about team dynamics, and building a car to take to competition (hopefully when the COVID 19 situation is over) it has proven to be an incredible academic year.

          As a kid, I would be always messing around with something; constantly tinkering and seeing how things are put together. If there was something that didn't fit my needs, I altered it accordingly. Taking things apart, studying products, and understanding how it could be optimized are all part of my game. Fast forwarding to now, nothing much has changed. I have received an Associates of Science degree in CNC machining and programming in 2017 and have been a contributing member of Spartan Racing FSAE team since 2018. For the team, I have manufactured parts and help support the car during test days. I enjoy machining, using the lathe, and laying up carbon. It brings me joy seeing raw materials turn into race car parts. Being a current industrial design student at San Jose State University, I plan to develop my design skills into making the world as great as it can get.

          Joining FSAE has been one of the best experiences of my collegiate career. Joining the team during my first year, I was able to make friends and learn skills that have proved invaluable. Every team member has been incredibly kind and open, helping me to grow and learn about facets of engineering that I never imagined I would gain exposure to. The kind and friendly members helped to teach me carbon fiber manufacturing, CFD simulation, and system integration in a real world environment. Over the last year working on our Drag Reduction System, I have been able to apply what I have learned over my college education; using dynamics and simulations to determine mechanical requirements, analyzing test data, and manufacturing a new system. As I graduate and begin working in the industry, I’ll look back on my years at FSAE and the friends made there fondly. I look forward to seeing our team members continue to learn and grow both on the team and as they begin their careers.

          FSAE has become a major cornerstone both in school and in life. Not only have I been able to apply the knowledge from my classes, but I have also learned so much from the program itself. From soft skills, such as leadership and time management, to hard skills, such as in-depth SolidWorks design and CFD, this team has taught me valuable skills to carry forward into my career. This year I designed the sidepods for SR-12, which aid in cooling the engine and contributing to the aerodynamics of the car. From design to manufacturing, you must keep in mind the big picture: “Why and how does this help the car?” I was faced with multiple challenges: meeting a weight goal, a downforce goal, and a cooling goal. Ultimately, I was able to overcome these challenges by utilizing a mold that allowed for more air to channel while keeping weight down, therefore aiding cooling. Outside of professional development, this team has a special place in my heart. Being a commuter student, I have little chance to meet people outside of my classes. This team has given me that chance to grow and make lifelong connections with people from all backgrounds. From day one, the team has welcomed me with open arms and smiles. They have laughed and cried with me, been with one another through thick and thin. I am truly thankful for the opportunities and for the friendships formed through this program.

          The system that I co-designed was the front wing. The front wing has the task of manipulating the incoming air to generate a force towards the ground. It works in conjunction with other aerodynamic components,  to push our vehicle firmly on the  ground. This “push”allows our vehicle to grip the ground, increasing its traction and cornering speed capabilities. A particular challenge with the front wing is its relation to other aerodynamic devices. While the placement of front wing allows it to receive a clear stream of air, it has the potential to disrupt the air flow to other aerodynamic devices; negating their effects. Thus, the front wing has to be designed with consideration to the other aerodynamic components. This consideration assists us in designing an optimized, effective and competitive vehicle.

          As a system designer, I oversaw the mounting structure that connected the front wing to the chassis and I was a co-designer for the front wing. The purpose of the front wing is to create a downforce that will allow the tires to transmit a greater thrust force that will maximize the vehicle’s acceleration and to direct the vehicle’s airflow. The front wing itself governs the overall aerodynamics of the car, while the goal of the mount is to withstand the aerodynamic force of the downforce and drag generated by the front wing. In addition to these forces, cone hits of varying forces cannot be ignored and must be included when designing the structure. Challenges that I faced as a designer was learning new software that uses Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD), Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and implementing them to the subsystems. To overcome these challenges, I repeated the process multiple times and discussed possible solutions with my teammates. This experience led me to understand each step and learn important skills that I could take into industry.

          FSAE to me is really all about the opportunities. The opportunity to learn, to create, and most importantly to make mistakes. Joining this team grants you access to industry standard software and materials that as a college student might seem previously out of reach. We provide the tools and guidance for members to grow as engineers. Sometimes, we just provide the tools and encourage members to figure out the rest themselves. This ability to learn new skill-sets on your own is truly valuable, and employers recognize this. This approach isn’t always the most efficient, and mistakes are to be expected. I couldn’t tell you how much carbon fiber I’ve thrown away through my own learning process, but I never felt discouraged. When I became a Lead, I focused on keeping that friendly environment to help my members cultivate their talent. In the end, the car we build is only a byproduct of what this team truly achieves. What we truly build are a group of engineers ready to face any challenge.

          I still remember the High school trip I took when I first saw and met this team. I was immediately hooked on the automotive appeal of racing and the chance at winning a Motorsport competition. The idea of racing hooked me, but something else kept me coming back. I soon learned FSAE meant more than building race cars, it meant being a part of a team. As a collective, we grow and evolve towards excellence. Although coursework has contributed to the skills I use on the team. A large portion of my skills has come from problem-solving on this team. The cycle we experience is a grind. Whether it's design, manufacturing, or testing we are always reminded that there is a larger picture. What I love the most about Formula is that at each step of the process we develop into better real-world problem solvers. FSAE has been the first place where I finally mix my passion and my career together. One of the lessons I have taken away from this team is when your able to align passion and dedication you can achieve amazing feats. Formula has granted me the chance to grow as an Engineer and as a person and I will be forever grateful for this experience.

          Prior to starting my bachelor's at SJSU I had known about Formula SAE through other friends who participated in the same program in other universities. I was intimidated initially and waited almost 2 years before finally deciding to join the team. If time traveling was possible I would have definitely kicked myself in the bum for having waited at all. The experiences that I acquired are invaluable and the opportunities that I was exposed to were well beyond my expectations. The camaraderie that I built with this group is something I find very rewarding as we're all like-minded and driven towards common goals. If you're a motorsports enthusiast, business major, engineering major, or someone who loves to learn, then this is the place for you.

          As the president of FSAE I have been responsible for mentoring and leading the business team members and creating a knowledge transfer program. I pioneered changes in fundamental team structure for the betterment of members and team performance. Additionally, I facilitated outreach to potential sponsors and partners to organize networking events. Through this role I have had the opportunity to not only oversee and help lead and mentor the entire team, but I have also had the opportunity to better understand the true meaning of FSAE, that we all are a part of one family, and worked to realize that meaning for all members.

          The Vehicle Dynamics team is responsible for maximizing the performance we get out of the car. This involves setting overall vehicle design parameters, selecting spring rates and dampers, determining the correct aero balance, tuning the car once it's built, and much more. As a part of the vehicle dynamics team, you will be exposed to a lot of vehicle modelling in programs such as MATLAB and Simulink, as well as an equal amount of hands-on tuning.

Spartan Racing and Formula SAE have been some of the fastest pace learning that I have ever encountered. The late nights, the community, and the firehose of knowledge is what has made me come back for another round as I work on my master's degree. FSAE is what originally landed me an internship during school and subsequent job when I finished my bachelor's. To come back to school and impart what little I have to give while learning more and getting to go back to working on a racecar is awesome. I look forward to trying my hand at managing the Vehicle Dynamics team as we try to wrap our heads around maximizing Spartan Racing's competitiveness through the use of points analysis, tire models, lapsims, and tuning to extend our vehicle's performance envelope.          </p>
